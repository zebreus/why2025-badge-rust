//! Raw bindings to the functions exported by the WHY2025 badge
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! The bindings are autogenerated from the headers present in the firmware, so they are not exactly idiomatic rust.
//!
//! The symbols definitely need more documentation. If you want to add some, please add it to the C code in the firmware repository, it will get picked up when rebuilding lib.rshift
//!
//! ## Interesting symbols
//!
//! * [printf]
//! * [window_create]
//! * [window_framebuffer_create]
//! * [window_present]

// #![no_std]
#![allow(nonstandard_style)]
#![allow(non_camel_case_types)]
#![feature(c_variadic)]
#![feature(linkage)]
